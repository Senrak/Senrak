- My name is Brayden Karnes also known as Senrak.  I have more than enough of my own projects, but I am looking for opportunities to gain experience as a professional.
- I am passionate about Cybersecurity, Computer Science, and the intersection of the two.
- My favorite language is Python but am familiar with many object-oriented and data manipulation languages.
- I would love to collaborate on security tools, scripts, and new methods of insuring information security.
- I can be reached by email at:
  Email: braydenk98@yahoo.com
  
- Current Goals:  I am currently looking to gain experience in a professional setting.  My years in school and my passion for learning on my own has left me with talents and skills
                  that would be useful to many organizations.  If you know of any entry level information security or entry level developer roles, I would be very grateful for your recommendation.
